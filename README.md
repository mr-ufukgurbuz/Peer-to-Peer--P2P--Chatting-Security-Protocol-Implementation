# Peer-to-Peer--P2P--Chatting-Security-Protocol-Implementation

  In this project, we implemented our own SSL protocol from scratch, without using any libraries, to provide message security for our P2P chat application we have already developed with my teammate. The intent here is that our project guarantees the following security features: Message Confidentiality, Peer Authentication and Message Integrity. In addition, this protocol provides the security of attackers such as "Replay Attacks", "Man-in-the-Middle Attack" and "Truncation Attack", which may come from outside.
